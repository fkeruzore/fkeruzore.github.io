I am a cosmologist, interested in galaxy clusters and in their use as cosmological probes.
My work focuses on the physical properties of galaxy clusters across the Universe, and in particular of the hot plasma forming the intracluster medium, and how they relate to the fundamental properties of the Universe.

I am currently working as a postdoc in the Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing team at the Argonne National Laboratory, where I mainly study galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations, as well as in data from the South Pole Telescope.

Prior to that, I was working as a PhD student at the Laboratoire de Physique Subatomique et Cosmologie (Universite Grenoble Alpes, France), whew my work focused on high-resolution observations of galaxy clusters with the NIKA2 camera.
