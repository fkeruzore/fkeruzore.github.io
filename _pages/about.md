I am a cosmologist, currently working as a postdoc in the Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing team at the Argonne National Laboratory.
I am particularly interested in galaxy clusters, from their exploitation in cosmological analyses to the study of their physical properties; and the impact of the latter on the former.
