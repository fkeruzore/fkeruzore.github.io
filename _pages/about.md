I am a cosmologist, currently working as a postdoc in the Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing team at the Argonne National Laboratory.
I am particularly interested in galaxy clusters observed at millimeter wavelengths, and on the relation between their physical properties and their exploitation as a cosmological probe.
