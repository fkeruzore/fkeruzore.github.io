Machine learning and artificial intelligence are transforming astrophysics, offering new approaches to data analysis, simulation, and prediction.
I apply ML/AI techniques to astrophysical problems, particularly in the context of galaxy cluster science and cosmological simulations.

These projects leverage modern deep learning frameworks and computational techniques to solve complex problems in cluster astrophysics, from emulating expensive simulations to extracting information from observational data.
