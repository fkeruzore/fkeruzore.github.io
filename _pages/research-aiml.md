Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming astrophysics, offering new approaches to data analysis, simulation, and prediction.
I apply AI/ML techniques to astrophysical problems, particularly in the context of galaxy cluster science and cosmological simulations.

These projects leverage modern deep learning frameworks and computational techniques to solve complex problems in cosmology, from emulating expensive simulations to modeling cosmological observables.
