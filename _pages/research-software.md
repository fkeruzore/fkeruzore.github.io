Open-source software development is a crucial part of modern astronomy, enabling reproducible research and collaborative science.
I develop and maintain several software tools for cluster science, focusing on accessibility, performance, and ease of use.

My software projects aim to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and observational data, providing the community with tools for analyzing tSZ observations, fitting pressure profiles, performing statistical analyses, and generating synthetic datasets.
These tools are designed to be flexible and general-purpose, working with data from various instruments and surveys.

All software projects are publicly available on GitHub with comprehensive documentation, example notebooks, and continuous integration testing.
