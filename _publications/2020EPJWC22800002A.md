abstract: "Clarifying the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process is crucial. Observations have already shown that magnetic fields play an important role in the early stages of star formation. The high spatial resolution (âˆ¼0.01 to 0.05 pc) provided by NIKA2-Pol 1.2 mm imaging polarimetry of nearby clouds will help us clarify the geometry of the B-field within dense cores and molecular filaments as part of the IRAM 30m large program B-FUN. There are numerous challenging issues in the validation of NIKA2-Pol such as the calibration of instrumental polarization. The commissioning phase of NIKA2-Pol is underway and is helping us characterize the intensity-to-polarization \"leakage\" pattern of the instrument. We present a preliminary analysis of the leakage pattern and its dependence with elevation. We also present the current leakage correction made possible by the NIKA2 pipeline in polarization mode based on the NIKA2-Pol commissioning data taken in December 2018. Based on reduced Stokes I, Q, U data we find that the leakage pattern of NIKA2-Pol depends on elevation and is sensitive to the focus of the telescope."
