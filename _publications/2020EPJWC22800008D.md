abstract: "The NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Large Program (SZLP) is focused on mapping the thermal SZ signal of a representative sample of selected Planck and ACT clusters spanning the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.9. Hydrodynamical N-body simulations prove to be a powerful tool to endorse NIKA2 capabilities for estimating the impact of IntraCluster Medium (ICM) disturbances when re- covering the pressure radial profiles. For this goal we employ a subsample of objects, carefully extracted from the catalog Marenostrum MUltidark SImulations of galaxy Clusters (MUSIC), spanning equivalent redshift and mass ranges as the LPSZ. The joint analysis of real observations of the tSZ with NIKA2 and Planck enables to validate the NIKA2 pipeline and to estimate the ICM pressure profiles. Moreover, the possibility to identify a priori the dynamical state of the selected synthetic clusters allows us to verify the impact on the recovered ICM profile shapes and their scatters. Morphological analysis of maps of the Compton parameter seems to be a way to observationally segregate the sample based on the dynamical state in relaxed and disturbed synthetic clusters."
