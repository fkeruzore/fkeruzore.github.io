abstract: "The new NIKA2 camera at the IRAM 30m radiotelescope was used to observe three known debris disks in order to constrain the SED of their dust emission in the millimeter wavelength domain. We have found that the spectral index between the two NIKA2 bands (1mm and 2mm) is consistent with the Rayleigh-Jeans regime (λ<SUP>-2</SUP>), unlike the steeper spectra (λ<SUP>-3</SUP>) measured in the submillimeter-wavelength domain for two of the three disks - around the stars Vega and HD107146. We provide a succesful proof of concept to model this spectral inversion in using two populations of dust grains, those smaller and those larger than a grain radius a<SUB>0</SUB> of 0.5mm. This is obtained in breaking the slope of the size distribution and the functional form of the absorption coefficient of the standard model. The third disk - around the star HR8799 - does not exhibit this spectral inversion but is also the youngest."
