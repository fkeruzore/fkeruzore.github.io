abstract: "The main limiting factor of cosmological analyses based on thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster statistics comes from the bias and systematic uncertainties that affect the estimates of the mass of galaxy clusters. High-angular resolution SZ observations at high redshift are needed to study a potential redshift or morphology dependence of both the mean pressure profile and of the mass-observable scaling relation used in SZ cosmological analyses. The NIKA2 camera is a new generation continuum instrument installed at the IRAM 30-m telescope. With a large field of view, a high angular resolution and a high-sensitivity, the NIKA2 camera has unique SZ mapping capabilities. In this paper, we present the NIKA2 SZ large program, aiming at observing a large sample of clusters at redshifts between 0.5 and 0.9, and the characterization of the first cluster oberved with NIKA2."
