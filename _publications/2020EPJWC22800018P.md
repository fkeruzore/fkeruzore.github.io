abstract: "Understanding where and when the mass of stars is determined is one of the fundamental, mostly unsolved, questions in astronomy. Here, we present the first results of GASTON, the Galactic Star Formation with NIKA2 large programme on the IRAM 30m telescope, that aims to identify new populations of low-brightness sources to tackle the question of stellar mass determination across all masses. In this paper, we focus on the high-mass star formation part of the project, for which we map a ~ 2 deg<SUP>2</SUP> region of the Galactic plane around l = 24Â° in both 1.2 mm and 2.0 mm continuum. Half-way through the project, we reach a sensitivity of 3.7 mJy/beam at 1.2mm. Even though larger than our target sensitivity of 2 mJy, the current sensitivity already allows the identification of a new population of cold, compact sources that remained undetected in any (sub-)mm Galactic plane survey so far. In fact, about 25% of the ~ 1600 compact sources identified in the 1.2mm GASTON image are new detections. We present a preliminary analysis of the physical properties of the GASTON sources as a function of their evolutionary stage, arguing for a potential evolution of the mass distribution of these sources with time."
