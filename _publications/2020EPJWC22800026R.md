abstract: "We present the results of the analysis of the very massive cluster MOO J1142+1527 at a redshift z = 1.2 based on high angular resolution NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) and Chandra X-ray data. This multi-wavelength analysis enables us to estimate the shape of the temperature profile with unprecedented precision at this redshift and to obtain a map of the gas entropy distribution averaged along the line of sight. The comparison between the cluster morphological properties observed in the NIKA2 and Chandra maps together with the analysis of the entropy map allows us to conclude that MOOJ1142+1527 is an on-going merger hosting a cool-core at the position of the X-ray peak. This work demonstrates how the addition of spatially-resolved SZ observations to low signal-to-noise X-ray data can bring valuable insights on the intracluster medium thermodynamic properties at z &gt; 1."
