abstract: "As the possible progenitors of passive galaxies at z=2-3, dusty starforming galaxies (DSFGs) at z&gt;4 provide a unique perspective to study the formation, assembly, and early quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe. The extreme obscuration in optical-IR makes (sub)mm spectral scans the most universal and unbiased way to confirm/exclude the high-z nature of candidate dusty star-forming galaxies. We present here the status of the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS), which is the deepest wide-area singledish survey in the millimeter searching for high-z DSFGs. We also introduce a joint-analysis method to effciently search for the spectroscopic redshift of high-z DSFGs with noisy spectra and photometric data and present its success in identifying the redshift of DSFGs found in NIKA2 science verification data."
