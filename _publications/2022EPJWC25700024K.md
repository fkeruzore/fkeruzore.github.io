abstract: "We have developed a new software to perform the measurement of galaxy cluster pressure profiles from high angular resolution thermal SZ observations. The code allows the user to take into account various features of millimeter observations, such as point spread function (PSF) convolution, pipeline filtering, correlated residual noise, and point source contamination, in a forward modeling approach. A major advantage of this software is its performance, enabling the extraction of the pressure profile and associated confidence intervals via MCMC sampling in times as short as a few minutes. We present the code and its validation on various realistic synthetic maps, of ideal spherical clusters, as well as of realistic, hydrodynamically simulated objects. We plan to publicly release the software in the coming months."
