abstract: "Using the NIKA2 dual band millimeter camera installed on the IRAM30m telescope, we have mapped a relatively large field (~ 70 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>) in the direction of the star GJ526 to investigate the nature of the sources found with the MAMBO camera at 1.2 mm ten years earlier. We have found that they must be dust-obscured galaxies (SMGs) in the background beyond the star. The new NIKA2 map at 1.15 mm reveals additional sources and, in fact, an overdensity of SMGs predominantly distributed along a filament-like structure in projection on the sky across the whole observed field. We speculate this might be a cosmic filament at high redshift as revealed in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Measurement of spectroscopic redshifts of the SMGs in the candidate filament is required now for a definitive confirmation of the nature of the structure."
