abstract: "We present a multi-probe analysis of the well-known galaxy cluster CL J1226.9+3332 as a proof of concept for multi-wavelength studies within the framework of the NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Large Program (LPSZ). CL J1226.9+3332 is a massive and high redshift (z = 0.888) cluster that has already been observed at several wavelengths. A joint analysis of the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect at millimeter wavelength with the NIKA2 camera and in X-ray with the XMM-Newton satellite permits the reconstruction of the cluster's thermodynamical properties and mass assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. We test the robustness of our mass estimates against different definitions of the data analysis transfer function. Using convergence maps reconstructed from the data of the CLASH program we obtain estimates of the lensing mass, which we compare to the estimated hydrostatic mass. This allows us to measure the hydrostatic-to-lensing mass bias and the associated systematic effects related to the NIKA2 measurement. We obtain M<SUB>500</SUB><SUP>HSE</SUP> = (7:65 ± 1:03) × 10<SUP>14</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and M<SUB>500</SUB><SUP>lens</SUP> = (7:35 ± 0:65) × 10<SUP>14</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, which implies a HSE-to-lensing bias consistent with 0 within 20%."
