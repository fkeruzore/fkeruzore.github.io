abstract: "Starting from the clusters included in the NIKA sample and in the NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Large Program (LPSZ) we have selected a sample of six common objects with the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) lensing data. For the LPSZ clusters we have at our disposal both high-angular resolution observations of the thermal SZ with NIKA and NIKA2 and X-ray observations with XMM-Newton from which hydrostatic mass estimates can be derived. In addition, the CLASH dataset includes lensing convergence maps that can be converted into lensing estimates of the total mass of the cluster. One-dimensional mass profiles are used to derive integrated mass estimates accounting for systematic effects (data processing, modeling, etc.). Two-dimensional analysis of the maps can reveal substructures in the cluster and, therefore, inform us about the dynamical state of each system. Moreover, we are able to study the hydrostatic mass to lensing mass bias, across different morphology and a range of redshift clusters to give more insight on the hydrostatic mass bias. The analysis presented in this proceeding follows the study discussed in [20]."
