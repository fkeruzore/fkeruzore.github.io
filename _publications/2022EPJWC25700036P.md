abstract: "The simulation database of The Three Hundred Project has been used to pick synthetic clusters of galaxies with properties close to the observational targets of the NIKA2 camera Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) Large Program. Cross-matching of cluster parameters such as mass and redshift of the cluster in the two databases has been implemented to generate the so-called twin samples for the Large Program. This SZ Large Program is observing a selection of galaxy clusters at intermediate and high redshift (0:5 &lt; z &lt; 0:9), covering one order of magnitude in mass. These are SZ-selected clusters from the Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope catalogs, wherein the selection is based on their integrated Compton parameter values, Y<SUB>500</SUB>: the value of the parameter within the characteristics radius R<SUB>500</SUB>. The Three Hundred hydrodynamical simulations provide us with hundreds of clusters satisfying these redshift, mass, and Y<SUB>500</SUB> requirements. In addition to the standard post-processing analysis of the simulation, mock observational maps are available mimicking X-ray, optical, gravitational lensing, radio, and SZ observations of galaxy clusters. The primary goal of employing the twin samples is to compare different cluster mass proxies from synthetic X-ray, SZ effect and optical maps (via the velocity dispersion of member galaxies and lensing Îº-maps) of the clusters. Eventually, scaling laws between different mass proxies and the cluster mass will be cross-correlated to reduce the scatter on the inferred mass and the mass bias will be related to various physical parameters."
