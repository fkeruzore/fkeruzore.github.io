abstract: "The NIKA2 Guaranteed-Time SZ Large Program (LPSZ) is dedicated to the high-angular resolution SZ mapping of a representative sample of 45 SZ-selected galaxy clusters drawn from the catalogues of the Planck satellite, or of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The LPSZ sample spans a mass range from 3 to 11 × 10<SUP>14</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a redshift range from 0:5 to 0:9, extending to higher redshift and lower mass the previous samples dedicated to the cluster mass calibration and universal properties estimation. The main goals of the LPSZ are the measurement of the average radial profile of the ICM pressure up to R<SUB>500</SUB> by combining NIKA2 with Planck or ACT data, and the estimation of the scaling law between the SZ observable and the mass using NIKA2, XMM-Newton and Planck/ACT data. Furthermore, combining LPSZ data with existing or forthcoming public data in lensing, optical/NIR or radio domains, we will build a consistent picture of the cluster physics and further gain knowledge on the mass estimate as a function of the cluster morphology and dynamical state. We give an overview of the LPSZ, present recent results and discuss the future implication for cosmology with galaxy clusters."
