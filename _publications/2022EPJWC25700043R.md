abstract: "We present preliminary results from an on-going program that aims at mapping the intracluster medium (ICM) temperature of high redshift galaxy clusters from the MaDCoWS sample using a joint analysis of shallow X-ray data obtained by Chandra and high angular resolution Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations realized with the NIKA2 and MUSTANG-2 cameras. We also present preliminary results from an on-going Open Time program within the NIKA2 collaboration that aims at mapping the ICM temperature of a galaxy cluster at z = 0.45 from the resolved detection of the relativistic corrections to the SZ spectrum. These studies demonstrate how high angular resolution SZ observations will play a major role in the coming decade to push the investigation of ICM dynamics and non-gravitational processes to high redshift before the next generation X-ray observatories come into play."
