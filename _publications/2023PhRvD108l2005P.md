abstract: "We present a measurement of gravitational lensing over 1500 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the Southern sky using SPT-3G temperature data at 95 GHz and 150 GHz taken in 2018. The lensing amplitude relative to a fiducial Planck 2018 Lambda cold dark matter (Λ CDM ) cosmology is found to be 1.020 ±0.060 , excluding instrumental and astrophysical systematic uncertainties. We conduct extensive systematic and null tests to check the robustness of the lensing measurements, and report a minimum-variance combined lensing power spectrum over angular multipoles of 50 &lt;L &lt;2000 , which we use to constrain cosmological models. When analyzed alone and jointly with primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectra within the Λ CDM model, our lensing amplitude measurements are consistent with measurements from SPT-SZ, SPTpol, ACT, and Planck. Incorporating loose priors on the baryon density and other parameters including uncertainties on a foreground bias template, we obtain a 1 σ constraint on σ<SUB>8</SUB>Ω<SUB>m</SUB><SUP>0.25</SUP>=0.595 ±0.026 using the SPT-3G 2018 lensing data alone, where σ<SUB>8</SUB> is a common measure of the amplitude of structure today and Ω<SUB>m</SUB> is the matter density parameter. Combining SPT-3G 2018 lensing measurements with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, we derive parameter constraints of σ<SUB>8</SUB>=0.810 ±0.033 , S<SUB>8</SUB>≡σ<SUB>8</SUB>(Ω<SUB>m</SUB>/0.3 )<SUP>0.5</SUP>=0.836 ±0.039 , and Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB>=68.8<SUB>-1.6</SUB><SUP>+1.3</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> . Our preferred S<SUB>8</SUB> value is higher by 1.6 to 1.8 σ compared to cosmic shear measurements from DES-Y3, HSC-Y3, and KiDS-1000 at lower redshift and smaller scales. We combine our lensing data with CMB anisotropy measurements from both SPT-3G and Planck to constrain extensions of Λ CDM . Using CMB anisotropy and lensing measurements from SPT-3G only, we provide independent constraints on the spatial curvature of Ω<SUB>K</SUB>=0.01 4<SUB>-0.026</SUB><SUP>+0.023</SUP> (95% C.L.) and the dark energy density of Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB>=0.72 2<SUB>-0.026</SUB><SUP>+0.031</SUP> (68% C.L.). When combining SPT-3G lensing data with SPT-3G CMB anisotropy and BAO data, we find an upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of ∑m<SUB>ν</SUB>&lt;0.30 eV (95% C.L.). Due to the different combination of angular scales and sky area, this lensing analysis provides an independent check on lensing measurements by ACT and Planck."
