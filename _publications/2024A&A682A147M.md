abstract: "An accurate reconstruction of galaxy cluster masses is key to use this population of objects as a cosmological probe. In this work we present a study on the hydrostatic-to-lensing mass scaling relation for a sample of 53 clusters whose masses were reconstructed homogeneously in a redshift range between z = 0.05 and 1.07. The M<SUB>500</SUB> mass for each cluster was indeed inferred from the mass profiles extracted from the X-ray and lensing data, without using a priori observable-mass scaling relations. We assessed the systematic dispersion of the masses estimated with our reference analyses with respect to other published mass estimates. Accounting for this systematic scatter does not change our main results, but enables the propagation of the uncertainties related to the mass reconstruction method or used dataset. Our analysis gives a hydrostatic-to-lensing mass bias of (1−b) = 0.739<SUB>−0.070</SUB><SUP>+0.075</SUP> and no evidence of evolution with redshift. These results are robust against possible subsample differences."
