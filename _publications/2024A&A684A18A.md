abstract: "Context. The thermodynamical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) are driven by scale-free gravitational collapse, but they also reflect the rich astrophysical processes at play in galaxy clusters. At low masses (∼10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and high redshift (z ≳ 1), these properties remain poorly constrained, observationally speaking, due to the difficulty in obtaining resolved and sensitive data. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the inner structure of the ICM as seen through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in this regime of mass and redshift. We focused on the thermal pressure profile and the scaling relation between SZ flux and mass, namely the Y<SUB>SZ</SUB> − M scaling relation. <BR /> Methods: The three galaxy clusters XLSSC 072 (z = 1.002), XLSSC 100 (z = 0.915), and XLSSC 102 (z = 0.969), with M<SUB>500</SUB> ∼ 2 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, were selected from the XXL X-ray survey and observed with the NIKA2 millimeter camera to image their SZ signal. XMM-Newton X-ray data were used as a complement to the NIKA2 data to derive masses based on the Y<SUB>X</SUB> − M relation and the hydrostatic equilibrium. <BR /> Results: The SZ images of the three clusters, along with the X-ray and optical data, indicate dynamical activity related to merging events. The pressure profile is consistent with that expected for morphologically disturbed systems, with a relatively flat core and a shallow outer slope. Despite significant disturbances in the ICM, the three high-redshift low-mass clusters follow the Y<SUB>SZ</SUB> − M relation expected from standard evolution remarkably well. <BR /> Conclusions: These results indicate that the dominant physics that drives cluster evolution is already in place by z ∼ 1, at least for systems with masses above M<SUB>500</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. <P />The FITS file of the published NIKA2 maps are available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\\"https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr\\">cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\\"https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/684/A18\\">https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/684/A18</A>."
