abstract: "We present a flare star catalog from 4 yr of nontargeted millimeter-wave survey data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The data were taken with the SPT-3G camera and cover a 1500 deg<SUP>2</SUP> region of the sky from 20<SUP>h</SUP>40<SUP>m</SUP>0<SUP>s</SUP> to 3<SUP>h</SUP>20<SUP>m</SUP>0<SUP>s</SUP> in right ascension and from ‑42° to ‑70° in declination. This region was observed on a nearly daily cadence from 2019 to 2022 and chosen to avoid the plane of the galaxy. A short-duration transient search of this survey yields 111 flaring events from 66 stars, increasing the number of both flaring events and detected flare stars by an order of magnitude from the previous SPT-3G data release. We provide cross-matching to Gaia DR3, as well as matches to X-ray point sources found in the second ROSAT all-sky survey. We have detected flaring stars across the main sequence, from early-type A stars to M dwarfs, as well as a large population of evolved stars. These stars are mostly nearby, spanning 10–1000 pc in distance. Most of the flare spectral indices are constant or gently rising as a function of frequency at 95/150/220 GHz. The timescale of these events can range from minutes to hours, and the peak ν L <SUB> ν </SUB> luminosities range from 10<SUP>27</SUP> to 10<SUP>31</SUP> erg s<SUP>‑1</SUP> in the SPT-3G frequency bands."
