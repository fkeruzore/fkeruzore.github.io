abstract: "We forecast constraints on cosmological parameters enabled by three surveys conducted with SPT-3G, the third-generation camera on the South Pole Telescope. The surveys cover separate regions of 1500, 2650, and 6000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> to different depths, in total observing 25% of the sky. These regions will be measured to white noise levels of roughly 2.5, 9, and <inline-formula> <mml:math overflow=\"scroll\"><mml:mn>12</mml:mn><mml:mspace width=\"0.33em\"></mml:mspace><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">K</mml:mi></mml:math> </inline-formula>-armin, respectively, in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature units at 150 GHz by the end of 2024. The survey also includes measurements at 95 and 220 GHz, which have noise levels a factor of ∼1.2 and 3.5 times higher than 150 GHz, respectively, with each band having a polarization noise level <inline-formula> <mml:math overflow=\"scroll\"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:math> </inline-formula> times higher than the temperature noise. We use a novel approach to obtain the covariance matrices for jointly and optimally estimated gravitational lensing potential band powers and unlensed CMB temperature and polarization band powers. We demonstrate the ability to test the ΛCDM model via the consistency of cosmological parameters constrained independently from SPT-3G and Planck data, and consider the improvement in constraints on ΛCDM extension parameters from a joint analysis of SPT-3G and Planck data. The ΛCDM cosmological parameters are typically constrained with uncertainties up to ∼2 times smaller with SPT-3G data, compared to Planck, with the two data sets measuring significantly different angular scales and polarization levels, providing additional tests of the standard cosmological model."
