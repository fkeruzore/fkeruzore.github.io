abstract: "Three galaxy clusters selected from the XXL X-ray survey at high redshift and low mass (z ~ 1 and M<SUB>500</SUB> ~ 1 - 2 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) were observed with NIKA2 to image their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) signal. They all present an SZ morphology, together with the comparison with X-ray and optical data, that indicates dynamical activity related to merging events. Despite their disturbed intracluster medium, their high redshifts, and their low masses, the three clusters follow remarkably well the pressure profile and the SZ flux-mass relation expected from standard evolution. This suggests that the physics that drives cluster formation is already in place at z ~ 1 down to M<SUB>500</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>."
