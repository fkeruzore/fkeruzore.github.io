abstract: "We present a study on the bias of hydrostatic masses with respect to lensing mass estimates for a sample of 53 clusters in a redshift range between z = 0.05 and 1.07. The M<SUB>500</SUB> mass for each cluster was inferred from X-ray and lensing data, without using a priori observable-mass scaling relations. Cluster masses of our reference analysis were reconstructed homogeneously and we assess the systematic dispersion of those homogeneous masses with respect to other published mass estimates. We obtain an hydrostatic-to-lensing mass bias of (1 ‒ b) = 0.74<SUB>‒0.07</SUB><SUP>+0.08</SUP> and no significant evidence of evolution with redshift."
