abstract: "We present a morphological analysis of a set of spiral galaxies from the NIKA2 Guaranteed Time Large Program, IMEGIN. We have fitted a single SÃ©rsic model on a set of broadband images, from ultra-violet (UV) to millimeter (mm) wavelengths, using the modelling code Statmorph. With the recently acquired NIKA2 1.15- and 2-mm observations, it is possible to extend such a morphological analysis to the mm regime and investigate the two-dimensional (2D) distribution (exponential, Gaussian) of the very cold dust (&lt;15 K). We show preliminary results of the 2D large-scale distribution of stars and dust in spiral galaxies, how they relate to each other, and highlight how they differ from galaxy to galaxy."
