abstract: "To understand the evolution of dust properties in molecular clouds in the course of the star formation process, we constrain the changes in the dust emissivity index from star-forming filaments to prestellar and protostellar cores to T Tauri stars. Using the NIKA2 continuum camera on the IRAM 30 m telescope. we observed the Taurus B211/B2I3 filament at 1.2 mm and 2 mm with unprecedented sensitivity and used the resulting maps to derive the dust emissivity index β. Our sample of 105 objects detected in the β map of the B211/B213 filament indicates that, overal. β decreases from filament and prestellar cores (β ~ 2 ± 0.5) to protostellar cores (β ~ 1.2 ± 0.2) to T-Tauri protoplanetary disk (β &lt; I). The averaged dust emissivity index β across the B211/B2I3 filament exhibits a flat (β ~ 2 ± 0.3) profile. This may imply that dust grain sizes are rather homogeneous in the filament, start to grow significantly in size only after the onset of the gravitational contraction/collapse of prestellar cores to protostars, reaching big sizes in T Tauri protoplanetary disks. This evolution from the parent filament to T-Tauri disks happens on a timescale of about 1-2 Myr."
