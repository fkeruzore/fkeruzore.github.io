abstract: "The NIKA2 camera operating at the IRAM 30-m telescope excels in high-angular resolution mapping of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect towards galaxy clusters at intermediate and high-redshift. As part of the NIKA2 guaranteed-time, the SZ Large Program (LPSZ) aims at tSZ-mapping a representative sample of SZ-selected galaxy clusters in the catalogues of the Planck satellite and of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and also observed in X-ray with XMM-Newton or Chandra. Having completed observations in January 2023, we present tSZ maps of 38 clusters spanning the targeted mass (3 &lt; M<SUB>500</SUB>/10<SUP>14</SUP>M<SUB>âŠ™</SUB> &lt; 10) and redshift (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.9) range. The first in-depth studies of individual clusters highlight the potential of combining tSZ and X-ray observations at similar angular resolution for precised mass measurements under the hydrostatic assumption M<SUB>HSE</SUB>. These were milestones for the development of a standard data analysis pipeline to go from NIKA2 raw data to the thermodynamic properties of galaxy clusters for the upcoming LPSZ data release. Final products will include measurements of the mean pressure profile of unprecedented quality and M<SUB>HSE</SUB>-observable scaling relation using a distinctive SZ-selected sample, which will be key for ultimately improving the accuracy of cluster-based cosmology."
