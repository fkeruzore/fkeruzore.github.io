abstract: "We present a catalog of 689 galaxy cluster candidates detected at significance $\\xi&gt;4$ via their thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature in 95 and 150 GHz data from the 500-square-degree SPTpol survey. We use optical and infrared data from the Dark Energy Camera and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and \\spitzer \\ satellites, to confirm 544 of these candidates as clusters with $\\sim94\\%$ purity. The sample has an approximately redshift-independent mass threshold at redshift $z&gt;0.25$ and spans $1.5 \\times 10^{14} &lt; M_{500c} &lt; 9.1 \\times 10^{14}$ $M_\\odot/h_{70}$ \\ and $0.03&lt;z\\lesssim1.6$ in mass and redshift, respectively; 21\\% of the confirmed clusters are at $z&gt;1$. We use external radio data from the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) to estimate contamination to the SZ signal from synchrotron sources. The contamination reduces the recovered $\\xi$ by a median value of 0.032, or $\\sim0.8\\%$ of the $\\xi=4$ threshold value, and $\\sim7\\%$ of candidates have a predicted contamination greater than $\\Delta \\xi = 1$. With the exception of a small number of systems $(&lt;1\\%)$, an analysis of clusters detected in single-frequency 95 and 150 GHz data shows no significant contamination of the SZ signal by emission from dusty or synchrotron sources. This cluster sample will be a key component in upcoming astrophysical and cosmological analyses of clusters. The SPTpol millimeter-wave maps and associated data products used to produce this sample are available at https://pole.uchicago.edu/public/data/sptpol_500d_clusters/index.html, and the NASA LAMBDA website. An interactive sky server with the SPTpol maps and Dark Energy Survey data release 2 images is also available at NCSA https://skyviewer.ncsa.illinois.edu."
