abstract: "In Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) cluster cosmology, two tools are needed to be able to exploit data from large scale surveys in the millimeter-wave domain. An accurate description of the IntraCluster Medium (ICM) pressure profile is needed along with the scaling relation connecting the SZ brightness to the mass. With its high angular resolution and large field of view, The NIKA2 camera, operating at 150 and 260 GHz, is perfectly suited for precise cluster SZ mapping. The SZ Large Program (LPSZ) of the NIKA2 collaboration is dedicated to the observation of a sample of 38 SZ-selected clusters at intermediate to high redshift and observed both in SZ and X-ray. The current status is that all LPSZ clusters have been observed and the analysis toward the final results is ongoing. We present in detail how NIKA2-LPSZ will obtain a robust estimation of the SZ-Mass scaling relation and how it will be used to obtain cosmological constraints."
