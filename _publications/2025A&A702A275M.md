abstract: "We present first detailed maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect on a z = 0.89 cluster with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The high sensitivity of these observations enabled the effective identification and removal of the millimetre-wave sources contaminating the tSZ signal, thus isolating the influence of the hot electron gas of the cluster on the cosmic microwave background radiation from other emissions. The tSZ observed with success by NOEMA was modelled together with previous single-dish observations (IRAM 30-metre, Green Bank Telescope, and Caltech Sub-millimeter Observatory) to obtain the first core-to-outskirts (from ∼15 to ∼1500 kpc) pressure profile reconstruction on such a high-redshift galaxy cluster. NOEMA observations with a high angular resolution have shown that the pressure profile is flat in the core of the cluster. These observations confirm the disturbed nature of CL J1226.9+3332 and map for the first time the distribution of its thermal gas at arcsecond scales in the environments of the central cluster galaxy. Our results showcase the excellent capabilities of NOEMA to complement and enhance the data provided by other millimetre-wave instruments in resolving the core of high-redshift clusters via tSZ emission."
