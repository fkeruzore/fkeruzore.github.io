abstract: "We present a catalog of 500 galaxy cluster candidates in the SPT-Deep field: a 100 deg$^2$ field that combines data from the SPT-3G and SPTpol surveys to reach noise levels of 3.0, 2.2, and 9.0 $\\mu$K-arcmin at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. This is comparable to noise levels expected for the wide field survey of CMB-S4, a next-generation CMB experiment. Candidates are selected via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with a minimum significance of $\\xi = 4.0$, resulting in a catalog of purity $\\sim 89 \\%$. Optical data from the Dark Energy Survey and infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope are used to confirm 442 cluster candidates. The clusters span $0.12 &lt; z \\lesssim 1.8$ and $1.0 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}/h_{70} &lt; M_{500c} &lt; 8.7 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}/h_{70}$. The sample's median redshift is 0.74 and the median mass is $1.7 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}/h_{70}$; these are the lowest median mass and highest median redshift of any SZ-selected sample to date. We assess the effect of infrared emission from cluster member galaxies on cluster selection by performing a joint fit to the infrared dust and tSZ signals by combining measurements from SPT and overlapping submillimeter data from Herschel/SPIRE. We find that at high redshift ($z&gt;1)$, the tSZ signal is reduced by $17.4^{+3.1}_{-2.9} \\%$ ($3.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}\\%$) at 150 GHz (95 GHz) due to dust contamination. We repeat our cluster finding method on dust-nulled SPT maps and find the resulting catalog is consistent with the nominal SPT-Deep catalog, demonstrating dust contamination does not significantly impact the SPT-Deep selection function; we attribute this lack of bias to the inclusion of the SPT 220 GHz band."
