abstract: "Context. The South Pole Telescope third-generation camera (SPT-3G) has observed over 10 000 square degrees of sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz (3.3, 2.0, 1.4 mm, respectively) and will significantly overlap the ongoing 14 000 square-degree Euclid Wide Survey. The Euclid collaboration recently released Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S) observations of 23 square degrees at wide field depths in the first quick data release (Q1). Aims. With the goal of releasing complementary millimeter-wave data and encouraging legacy science, we performed dedicated observations of a 57-square-degree field overlapping the EDF-S. Methods. The observing time totaled 20 days, and we reached noise depths of 4.3, 3.8, and 13.2 μK-arcmin at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. Results. In this work we present the temperature maps and two catalogs constructed from these data. The emissive source catalog contains 601 objects (334 inside EDF-S) with 54% synchrotron-dominated sources and 46% thermal dust emission-dominated sources. The 5σ detection thresholds are 1.7, 2.0, and 6.5 mJy in the three bands. The cluster catalog contains 217 cluster candidates (121 inside EDF-S) with median mass M<SUB>500c</SUB> = 2.12 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>/h<SUB>70</SUB> and median redshift z = 0.70, corresponding to an order-of-magnitude improvement in cluster density over previous tSZ-selected catalogs in this region (3.81 clusters per square degree). Conclusions. The overlap between SPT and Euclid data will enable a range of multiwavelength studies of the aforementioned source populations. This work serves as the first step toward joint projects between SPT and Euclid and provides a rich dataset containing information on galaxies, clusters, and their environments."
