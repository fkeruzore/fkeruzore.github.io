abstract: "We report new measurements of millimeter-wave temperature power spectra in the angular multipole range $1700 \\le \\ell \\le 11,000$ (wavelengths $13^\\prime \\gtrsim λ\\gtrsim 2^\\prime$). We use two years of data in three observing bands centered near 95, 150, and 220 GHz from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope that cover a 1646 deg$^2$ region of the Southern sky. Using the measured power spectra, we present constraints on the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, radio galaxies, and cosmic infrared background (CIB). We find that inferred SZ powers are dependent on the detailed modeling of the thermal SZ-CIB correlation, and to a lesser extent on the assumed angular dependence of the SZ spectra. We report constraints for simulation-based model templates as well as fits where the angular dependencies of the SZ and CIB power spectra are allowed to vary. In the latter case at $\\ell=3000$, we find thermal SZ power at 143 GHz of $D_{3000}^{\\rm tSZ} = 4.91\\pm0.37\\, μ{\\rm K}^2$ and kinematic SZ power of $D_{3000}^{\\rm kSZ} =1.75\\pm0.86\\, μ{\\rm K}^2$. We use the measured kinematic SZ power to estimate the duration of reionization, noting that the reionization inferences are sensitive to the model choices and assumed level of homogeneous kinematic SZ power from the late-time universe. We find a 95% limit on the duration from an ionization fraction of 25% to 75% of $Δ^{50} z_{\\rm re} <\\,3.8$ based on a semi-analytic model, or a limit on the duration from an ionization fraction of 5% to 95% of $Δ^{90} z_{\\rm re} <\\,6.1$ based on the AMBER simulations."
